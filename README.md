# hero

A node.js and soket.io app that reads audio file and sends data to a mobile or tablet. The goal is to hit all the notes appearing on the handheld device. Kinda like guitarhero but not as good. If you want to test this repo pm me and I'll explain how to set it up. It's very much a work in progress.
